## Domain : Blockchain
### Problem Statement : Build a user verification system.
Description : 
- *If you go to a SIM Card company, Transport Facilities, Banks require you to submit a verified identity to conduct the transaction. 
Even government facilities require you to submit your identity proof. 
Most of the time it is the same data uploaded multiple times on multiple servers which may not always be reliable and secure.*
- *How do we intend to solve this problem ? Blockchain is the solution. Develop a one-stop portal where users can securely upload and maintain various personal documents. 
An authority wishing to verify certain documents of a particular user can access them using a unique UID. 
The verifier should be able to check the authenticity of the document using various parameters.*
